# WEEK 1

week1_intro = """Welcome to your first day of AP. You've heard quite a lot 
about this class, but now you're finally here. You already
got through Intro to Java and Data Structures just fine, 
but everyone keeps telling you that nothing can prepare you 
for the beast that is AP. 

You walk into the lecture hall feeling apprehensive, slowly
sit down in a remarkably uncomfortable chair, and wait for 
the professor to arrive. You think about what choices led you
to this moment, and consider prematurely giving up, walking
back to your dorm, and dropping the course on SSOL.

Do you want to give up already?"""

week1_no = """You decide that it's too late to give up, and stay seated.
After a few minutes, an extremely handsome albeit very 
intimidating man walks to the front of the room, sets down 
his bag, and connects his laptop to the projector. 

After a few minutes, he introduces himself as the professor and 
begins the lecture. His name is Jae Woo Lee, though he prefers
being called Jae. He spends the first lecture on logistics,
asks everyone to join the class listserv, and urges you to 
read a paper he wrote a long time ago about this class. 

You get the impression that you will learn alot, but that this
class will be very hard. As the lecture ends and you leave 
the lecture hall, you're not sure what to think.

That night, you dream that you are peacefully floating down
a river, towards the sea."""

week1_yes = """You decide this probably isn't for you, and decide that you
are going to switch to econ the second you get out of the
room. You're sure that investment bankers make just as much, 
if not more than software engineers anyway, so who needs to
work at Google? 

Getting out of your seat to leave the room, you wonder if
you'll regret this in the future, but at the same time you're 
relieved that you will never have to take AP, or even write a
single line of code ever again. """

# WEEK 2

week2_intro = """It is now the second week of AP. Last week, Jae very
strongly recommended everyone to do all their work for AP
in Vim. Despite its unassuming nature, Jae assures you that
it is by far the best environment for this class. You are not
convinced. This week, you are introduced to some of the
standard C library, makefiles, and separate compilation.
Admittedly, it is a little confusing. 

After the lecture, you arrive back at your dorm, still not
fully confident on what you just learned in lecture.

Do you want to review the lecture notes?"""

week2_no = """You decide not to review the lecture notes, and you figure
that Jae will probably go over it again in lecture anyway. 
Instead you decide to take a nap. After all, it's the beginning
of the semester anyway, and you don't have any homework yet. 

As you fall asleep, you wonder:

What was separate compilation again?"""

week2_yes = """You decide to be responsible, and look through all the
lecture notes. Reading through the notes again while 
remembering what Jae said in lecture, the concepts start to
make more sense. After about ten minutes of reading,
you feel significantly more confident in your knowledge
of the material. Good stuff."""

# WEEK 3

week3_intro = """Three weeks in now. In lecture, you learned what
Git is, and how to submit the homework labs through it. You 
also learned some nuances of the C language, like what felt
like a billion bitwise operators, postfix expressions, 
and storage classes. You didn't quite get the part about 
how the stack works. 

Arriving back at your dorm, you are once again faced with
the ultimate question:

Do you want to review the lecture notes?
"""

week3_no = """You decide your time would be better spent browsing 
SideChat until you fall asleep. 

You still have no idea how the stack works."""

week3_yes = """Opening the lecture notes, you review Jae's diagram of 
the stack and data storage, and it makes more sense. After
fifteen minutes, you feel more confident in your grasp of 
the course content.

Maybe AP isn't too bad after all."""

# Week 4 (although some weeks are skipped)

week4_intro = """A few more weeks pass by. You've attended most of the
lectures until this point, and the material has definitely
gotten harder. The homework labs take large chunks out of 
your schedule, and the course material becomes increasingly
more difficult. You learn about Pointers, array, memory 
allocation, and most importantly, the Grand Unified Theory
(copyright pending).

There was also a lecture on qsort(), but you fell asleep,
so you wouldn't know unless you looked at the notes.

The question again arises:

Do you want to review the lecture notes?"""

week4_no = """You've grown tired of the course material, and you figure
that it won't make a difference to forgo review. You decide
that you'll just cram once it's time to take the midterm.

qsort() remains a mystery."""

week4_yes = """qsort()? You don't remember Jae talking about this
in lecture, so it must have been when you were asleep.

Well, atleast now you know what it is. It seems important,
maybe it'll be on the upcoming midterm."""

# Week 5 - Midterm 1

week5_intro = """Just like that, it's finally midterm time. All you've felt for
the past few nights is dread. Jae mentioned that the upcoming
exam would cover the first 2 labs, which you did complete, but
also all ANN emails, as well as material on the sample exams.

This last bit in partcular worries you, because the highest
you scored on any of the sample exams was a 52.

You already crammed a bit last night. Do you want to skip 
your other morning class to study more for the AP exam?"""

week5_intro_prep = """Just like that, it's finally midterm time. All you've felt for
the past few nights is dread. Jae mentioned that the upcoming
exam would cover the first 2 labs, which you did complete, but
also all ANN emails, as well as material on the sample exams.

This last bit in partcular worries you, because the highest
you scored on any of the sample exams was an 83.

You already crammed a bit last night. Do you want to skip 
your other morning class to study more for the AP exam?"""

week5_yes = """Walking into the midterm later that day, you feel
adequately prepared. After all, you've kept up with most if
not all the material. 

Admittedly, you do freak out a little when you see the exam,
and spend a few minutes calming down. However, once you 
do, you manage to get through the rest of the exam fairly
methodically.

You walk out feeling pretty decent."""

week5_no = """Walking into the midterm later that day, you realize:

You should have studied more.

Nothing on the exam paper makes sense, and you realize how
inadequately prepared you are. You are filled with regret.

Last second cramming didn't help at all.

You walk out of the room in tears."""

# Week 6 

week6_intro = """Getting back the midterm grades, which released the same
day, you did about as you expected. You figure there's no
need to dwell on the past, and think about more pressing
matters. Specifically, a lab is due in 3 days including
late days, but one of your friends invited you to a party
tonight. You know you SHOULD work on the lab, but you
really don't want to, and besides, you have 2 nights to 
work on it after tonight anyway.

Do you want to skip tonight's party to do work instead?"""

week6_yes = """In the end, you decide it's more important to give yourself
enough time to finish the lab. After all, you haven't even
started debugging yet, and you know that usually takes
longer than you expect. 

Admittedly, you do feel a twinge of FOMO, but after two days
you finish the lab and submit it on time without any errors."""

week6_no = """You really don't want to work on the lab, and want to miss
the party even less. 

You go out with your friends, and enjoy a stress-free night
of fun. However, the next day, you realize you won't finish
the lab on time, and regret having a social life. 

The week passes and you submit what you can, but the code
doesn't run as intended and you receive a poor grade on the
lab. 

There are also bits of skeleton code that you don't fully
understand that will probably also be on an exam in the
future, but you are unaware of this."""

# Week 7

week7_intro = """Recently, you've found that lecture material has gotten
significantly harder. There are bits of the material like
file pointers and forking which you find unintuitive. You
try looking over the lecture notes, but the concepts are
still cloudy. It would probably be better to get help from
someone who knows the material better.

Do you want to go to office hours to seek help from TAs?"""

week7_yes = """Once you get to the TA room, you wait a few minutes for a 
free TA to help you. 

After an hour, much of the material has been cleared up,
and you even got a bit of guidance on lab due in a week. 
Before, you were completely lost, but now you atleast have
a general idea of where to start."""

week7_no = """Instead of getting the help you so desperately need, you 
decide to go to the Wallach gaming lounge and get nothing
done for 3 hours. 

A week later, you end up barely submitting the homework lab
before the deadline, and you're not sure if it actually works
or not. """

# Week 8

week8_intro = """The semester is nearing the second exam, but before that,
there's another pressing matter. You've reached a point of
desperation.

With 2 days to submit the homework lab, you've hit a brick
wall. You've asked others for help, but you just can't figure 
out why your code doesn't work.

Despite being aware of AP and Jae's infamous anti-cheater
status, you realize that without looking at cheat code, you 
probably won't finish this lab on time.

Do you want to look at cheat code?"""

week8_yes = """Looking at a public github repository of AP solutions, you
find the lab you're working on, and realize what you messed
up. Though it was a small mistake, you decide that you might
as well just copy the reference code and change a few small
things to make the plagiarism undetectable.

You pray that Jae won't know. After all, it was a small piece
of code anyway. Surely you did enough to cover your tracks."""

week8_no = """You decide to stay honest and try your best to debug your
code before the deadline. Although you make slight progress,
it's ultimately not enough and you submit what you kmow to be
subpar code before the deadline. However, you take solace in
knowing that atleast you are at no risk of getting caught 
for using cheat code. 

Besides, the lowest lab gets dropped anyway."""

# Week 9 - Second midterm

week9_intro = """It's time for midterm number two. Jae said that the exam
would be cumulative, but with a greater focus on post-Exam 1
material. However, certain things from the first exam are
likely to show up. 

In addition to the new material, do you want to go back and
review the material from Exam 1?"""

week9_yes = """After studying the new material, you go back and refresh
your memory on the older content. 

On the exam, you thank your past self for going back and
studying, since there were a few questions based on Exam 1
material that your memory would have been hazy on, if not
for your extra review. 

The rest of the exam goes about how you would expect."""

week9_no = """The next day, looking at the exam, there are unfortunately
questions based on the older material. Though it looks
somewhat familiar, you're not too confident in your answers.

The rest of the exam goes about how you would expect."""

# Week 10 - Weeks leading up to the last exam. 

week10_intro = """The two weeks immediately following the second exam were
fine in terms of content difficulty, however, lab 7 is close
to absolutely breaking you. Sockets make no sense, and you 
barely managed to finish lab 6 with the help of TAs. Lab 7, 
which builds on lab 6, seems impossible. 

Once again, you are faced with the dilemma of whether to
look at cheat code. 

Will you do the right thing?"""

week10_yes = """Though you strongly consider using cheat code to get through
the lab, you decide not to. After pulling two consecutive
all nighters, you manage to finish and submit the lab.

Although it was painful, you feel good about yourself."""

week10_no = """You find lab 7 online, and copy it, not realizing that you
forgot to omit documentation containing the original
author's name. 

This will surely come back to haunt you."""

# Note to self, make sure cht = False after this if yes

# Week 11 - Third exam

week11_intro = """The rest of the semester goes by in a blur, and it's almost 
time for the third and last exam. Jae said fork and netcat
will be on the exam, but everything else is also fair game. 

Do you want to spend time preparing instead of waiting to
cram the night before? """

week11_yes = """You give yourself multiple days before the exam to make sure
you can cover all relevant material in your review, going
over all lecture notes, lab solutions, and anything else
that seems even marginally useful.

When it comes time to the take the test, you're glad you
didn't cram. There's no way you would have remembered all
the material that showed up on the exam in one night. 

You leave the exam feeling good."""

week11_no = """Since you have other exams coming up for other classes, you
decide to put off studying for the third AP Exam until
the night before. You cram until you fall asleep at your
desk.

The next day, when it's time to take the exam, you realize
the mistake you've made. There was too much material to
remember, and you're blanking on too many questions to
count. 

After getting absolutely violated by the exam, you walk
home defeated, but glad that the semester is over."""

# Week 12 - Final

week12_cheat = """Before you get back your final grade for the class, you
see an email sent to the listserv titled:

[cs3157] [ANN] Cheating in AP

Your heart sinks.

Reading the email, it says that all caught cheaters should
have gotten back a 0 for lab 7. Sure enough, your lab 7
grade is a big fat 0. 

The email implores everyone who got caught to come to Jae's
office and confess, but you decide in a state of panic to
fight the allegation. 

Arriving at Jae's office, there's a line of other similarly
depressed-looking people. After a bit, you make it inside,
where you take a deep breath, and tell Jae that you didn't
cheat, and that there must be some mistake.

He looks back at you with tired eyes, full of nothing but
disappointment. He shows you the exact code that you copied
your lab from. There is nothing you can say.

Needless to say, you fail AP."""

week12_a = """Getting back your final grade, you see that you got an A
in the class. But, of course you did. You did everything
you had to do, studied dilligently, and ultimately, it
was all worth it. The grade is a fruit of your labor, and
you feel fulfilled, knowing that your hard work paid off.

Looking back, you quite enjoyed the class. Obviously it
was difficult, but if you could go back, you would take
the class again in a heartbeat.""" 

week12_b = """Getting back your final grade, you see that you got a B+
in the class. That's about what you expected. You figured
you'd be about average in the class. There were some bumps
along the semester but overall, you're content with both
your grade, and what you learned in the class. 

You have no complaints. The class was difficult, but also
undeniably fair. You know exactly why you lost points on
the labs and tests, but overall, you can't be mad at
yourself. If anything, you're proud of getting through the
class with just your own honest work."""

week12_c = """Getting back your final grade, you see that you got a C
in the class. That's about what you expected. You know
that you definitely didn't put enough work in, and didn't
to use the resources available to you, like TAs and
office hours as much as you should have. 

However, you can't blame anyone but yourself. Next time 
you'll try harder, and do what you need to do to stay on
top of course materials. At this point, all you can do is
learn from your mistakes.

On the bright side, you didn't succumb to the temptation
of cheating on the labs. And for that, you can atleast be
proud of yourself. """
